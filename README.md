eppChat
=======

multi-client chat application with file tranfer capability.

There is a central server which handles all the connections. Each user can run his client
in order to connect to the server and start exchanging messages. The server and the users
have a list with all online users. The list is updated every time the status of the user is 
changed. A public room can be used if we want the messages to be visible to all connected 
users. There is also the ability for private message exchange between two users.

This application was a final project for the 'Network Programming' class of the Applied 
Informatics & Multimedia Department of TEI of Crete.
